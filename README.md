## Open Educational Resources for Teaching Machine Learning Systems Deployment

In this assignment, you will execute a sequence of experiments on the CloudLab or Chameleon testbed in order to learn more about deploying machine learning models to the cloud.

These instructions assume you have already completed the "Hello, CloudLab" or "Hello, Chameleon" sequence to configure your account and learn how to use the testbed.

* [Set up your experiment on CloudLab](reserve/index.md) or [Set up your experiment on Chameleon](reserve/reserve_resources_chameleon.ipynb)
* [Deploy model to a web service with Flask + Docker](deploy_app/index.md)
* [Deploy service using container orchestration (Kubernetes)](deploy_k8s/index.md)
* [Deploy a load balanced service](deploy_lb/index.md)
* [Deploy a service with dynamic scaling](deploy_hpa/index.md)
