## Open Educational Resources for Teaching Machine Learning Systems Deployment

In this assignment, you will execute a sequence of experiments on the CloudLab or Chameleon testbed in order to learn more about deploying machine learning models to the cloud.

These instructions assume you have already completed the [Hello, CloudLab](https://teaching-on-testbeds.github.io/blog/hello-cloudlab) or [Hello, Chameleon](https://teaching-on-testbeds.github.io/blog/hello-chameleon) sequence to configure your account and learn how to use the testbed.

* [Train your model](train_model/finetune_food_classification_model.ipynb)
* [Set up Kubernetes deployment on CloudLab](reserve/index.md) or [Set up Kubernetes deployment on Chameleon](reserve/reserve_resources_chameleon.ipynb)
* [Deploy model to a web service with Flask + Docker](deploy_app/index.md)
* [Deploy service using container orchestration (Kubernetes)](deploy_k8s/index.md)
* [Deploy a load balanced service](deploy_lb/index.md)
* [Deploy a service with dynamic scaling](deploy_hpa/index.md)
* [Optimize your deployment](challenge/index.md)
