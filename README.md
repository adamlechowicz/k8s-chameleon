## Deploying machine learning models

In this assignment, you will execute a sequence of experiments on the CloudLab testbed in order to learn more about deploying machine learning models to the cloud.

These instructions assume you have already completed the "Hello, CloudLab" sequence to configure your CloudLab account and learn how to use the testbed.

* [Set up your experiment on CloudLab](reserve/index.md)
* [Deploy image classification as a web service](deploy_app/index.md)
* [Deploy image classification with Kubernetes](deploy_k8s/index.md)
* [Deploy image classification with load balancing](deploy_lb/index.md)
* [Deploy image classification with dynamic scaling](deploy_hpa/index.md)
